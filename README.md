# A-novel-Approach-For-Pipeline-Generation-Using-Mixed-GA-and-Tree-Strategy
This project proposes a tree based generation strategy to generate a two-dimensional pipeline system for small areas, which involves first generating the backbone network and then generating the branch networks. Based on this strategy, this project used GA and GA_TSP problem solvers for solving. It can basically meet the generation needs of certain water supply and drainage pipe networks.
